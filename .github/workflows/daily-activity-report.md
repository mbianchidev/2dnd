# Weekly Repository Activity Report

Generate a comprehensive weekly activity report for the repository covering the past 7 days.

## Report Structure

Create a new issue with the current week's date range in the title and include the following sections:

### 📊 Summary
- Total number of commits pushed
- Total number of issues opened/closed
- Total number of PRs opened/merged/closed
- Total number of comments and discussions

### 💻 Commits
List recent commits with:
- Commit SHA (short form)
- Author
- Commit message (first line)
- Timestamp

### 🐛 Issues Activity
**Opened Issues:**
- List new issues with their number, title, and author

**Closed Issues:**
- List closed issues with their number, title, and who closed them

### 🔀 Pull Requests Activity
**Opened PRs:**
- List new PRs with their number, title, and author

**Merged PRs:**
- List merged PRs with their number, title, and who merged them

**Closed PRs (not merged):**
- List closed (but not merged) PRs

### 💬 Discussions & Comments
- Total number of comments across issues and PRs
- Notable discussion threads (if any with high activity)

## Time Range
Focus on activity from the past 7 days (since last week at this time).

## Formatting
- Use markdown formatting with headers, lists, and emojis
- Include clickable links to issues, PRs, and commits
- Keep it concise but informative
- If there's no activity in a section, write "No activity" instead of omitting the section
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include any footer text such as "AI generated by", workflow attribution, or automated system signatures at the end of the report - the workflow system will automatically add proper attribution
